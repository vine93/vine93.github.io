## Research Summary
<p align="justify">
I am involved in Computer Architecture, Software Systems and Approximate Computing research. My research focuses on 
building power and performance effecient datacenter infrastructure. I have been involved in the following projects as a Graduate Student.
</p>

*   **ConfigNVPSim** is a cycle accurate multicore simulator based out of gem5 simulation framework. ConfigNVPSim
simulates a non-volatile processor environment powered by renewable source of energy. In this context, ConfigNVPSim 
simulates functionality of non-volatile processors by throttling the progress of applications based on the energy 
levels present in the system. 
  
*   **PowerPrep** is a datacenter power management runtime system that aggressively enables cpu cores to enter deep 
    sleep states while executing datacenter application. PowerPrep tries to reduce datacenter power consumption without 
    affecting application defined Service Level Objectives. 
    
*   **Fluid** computing framework utilizes language and runtime extentions that allows expressions
    in source codes within which dataflow dependencies can be approximated.

## Brief Bio
<p align="justify">
I am a Masters Student of Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Pennsylvania State University. 
I have been fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Prof. Mahmut Kandameir and Prof. Jack Sampson.
Prior to that I was working as a hardware engineer at Samsung Semiconductors India Research and Development 
from 2016-2018 and Freescale Semiconductors India from 2015-2016. I obtained my undergraduate degree from National
 Institute of Technology Trichy, India, where I was majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
 I spent the first eighteen years of my life in the beautiful city of Madras (Chennai) in the southern part of India.
