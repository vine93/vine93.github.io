## Applying for PhD for the fall semester 2020. 
## [Curriculum Vitae](assets/pdfs/resume.pdf)


## Research Summary
<p align="justify">
I am involved in Computer Architecture, Software Systems and Approximate Computing research. My research focuses on 
building power and performance effecient datacenter infrastructure.These are the projects I have undertaken in my Master's program.
</p>

*   **ConfigNVPSim** is a cycle-accurate multicore simulator-based out of gem5 simulation framework. ConfigNVPSim
simulates a non-volatile processor environment powered by a renewable source of energy. In this context, ConfigNVPSim simulates the functionality of non-volatile processors by throttling the progress of applications based on the energy levels present in the system.
  
*   **PowerPrep** analyses the CPU behaviour of latency-critical workloads when deep sleep states are enabled.PowerPrep evaluates different scenarios under which enabling a deep sleep state violates SLO and proposes techniques to achieve energy proportionality while maintaining SLO in such workloads. 
    
*   **Fluid** computing framework utilizes language and runtime extensions that allow expressions
    in source codes within which dataflow dependencies can be approximated. Identified the set of workloads which are amenable for approximation and has improved execution time when running on the framework.

## Brief Bio
<p align="justify">
I am a Masters Student of Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Pennsylvania State University. 
I have been fortunate to be co-advised by <a href="https://vijay565.wixsite.com/vijay">Prof. Vijaykrishnan Narayanan</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/hpcl/kandemir/">Prof. Mahmut Kandameir</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~jms1257/">
Prof. Jack Sampson</a>. Prior to that I was working as a hardware engineer at Samsung Semiconductors India Research and Development 
from 2016-2018 and Freescale Semiconductors India from 2015-2016. I obtained my undergraduate degree from National
 Institute of Technology Trichy, India, where I was majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
 I spend a major part of my lifetime growing up in the vibrant city of Madras (Chennai)
